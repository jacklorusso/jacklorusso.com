    <p>
      When I'm not building products or tinkering with side projects, you'll
      either find me in one of Sydney's vegan cafes or doing my best to spend
      some time in nature. Whenever we can, my partner and I go on road trips or
      spend a weekend camping â€” it's nice to get out of the city some times!
