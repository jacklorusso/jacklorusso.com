helvetica: the movie

start with a lower case h

- is it a serif or sans
- what are the thick/thin proportions
- x-height and ascender

then go with a lowercase o

- h is a straight-backed letter, o is round
- has counter/bowl relationship

then go with a lower case p

- descender
- straight and round

if you've got an 'h', you have a lot of information about an 'n' and 'u'
if you've got an 'p', you have a lot of information about an 'q' and 'd'

as soon as possible, get the letterforms into words to learn how it reads
